                        Minecraft is one of the most popular survival games of all time. Do you know the lore behind the
                        game itself?
                        We will take a look into the lore and discuss the truth behind the drowned and the ocean
                        monuments. Looking at
                        minecraft from its in game "historical" background, we can dig deeper into the truth.
                        Theories say that old civilzations existed and floursihed with people, before the natural
                        disasters creating the world we see now.
                        We can assume that the natural disasters are what placed monuments under water through out the
                        game. This would
                        also mean the people living in the monuments and around them would have died in the natural
                        disasters. This
                        is what we see today as the drowned and ocean monuments. The more you know :P
