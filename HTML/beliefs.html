                Beliefs are something we hold and choose to live according too. Whether you feel you hold any or
                not, we
                all
                have them. It's faith in the seen and unseen. You might
                believe in something you see, such as the grass, sky, sun you get the point. I guarentee you believe
                in
                the
                unseen as well. The air around us, the belief you will wake
                up after sleeping, the love you feel for others, etc. What makes beliefs so controversial then? Is
                it
                the
                topic or idea of a flat earth? Several Genders? or maybe its our
                differing beliefs in God? The fact remains we all hold beliefs, and here are mine.

            <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Let's start with the most obvious, I believe in the Christian God. I have
                faith in God's existence, and believe it to be true.
