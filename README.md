 God Loves You! i have a lightsaber now

This is a personal project feel free to use the techniques I use like pulling HTML pages as links (it's fun and kinda need to know it if you want to be a web develper:). I have also made an interesting lightsaber in CSS. Needs work but its functional. Examine the .saberBlade and.textEdit to see how I put the blade behind the text. I pulled the sabers linear gradient design from the internet, so if you want to spice up the colors feel free to change that per your desired gradient colors. Last thing, I pulled the button style off the internet (if you know you know).

Happy Coding!
